# Template for creating Physics Simulations or Games with React, Vite, Typescript, p5.js and MatterJS

This template is designed to help you quickly set up a physics simulation or game using React, Vite, Typescript, p5.js, and MatterJS. It provides a basic structure and configuration to get you started with your project.

# Why use this template?

Most tutorials online are using Online Editors like the p5 Web Editor. Its fine for getting started, but nowadays we want to use our own IDEs and tools, because they offer tremendous advantages over online editors. For instance:

- **Code Completion**: IDEs provide code completion, which helps you write code faster and with fewer errors.
- **Debugging**: IDEs have powerful debugging tools that allow you to step through your code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.
- **Version Control**: IDEs integrate with version control systems like Git, making it easier to manage your code and collaborate with others.
- **Customization**: IDEs can be customized with plugins and themes to suit your workflow and preferences.
- **Performance**: IDEs are generally faster and more responsive than online editors, especially for larger projects.
- **Offline Access**: IDEs allow you to work on your projects offline, without relying on an internet connection.
